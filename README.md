# `apxproof`: Proofs in Appendix

## About

The `apxproof` package facilitates the writing of scientific article
with proofs deferred to the appendix. The documentation of this package
is provided in the [apxproof.pdf](apxproof.pdf) file.

## Prerequisites

In addition to a working installation of LaTeX2e, `apxproof` relies on a
few other packages, which should be provided by all reasonable LaTeX
distributions:
 - `amsthm`
 - `bibunits`
 - `environ`
 - `etoolbox`
 - `fancyvrb`
 - `ifthen`
 - `kvoptions`

## Manual installation

Simply copy the file [apxproof.sty](apxproof.sty) in your LaTeX working directory, or
in any other directory where LaTeX searches for packages.
